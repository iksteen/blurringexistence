I just published an initial version of my review of my new subnotebook /
mini-laptop / whatever it's called: [Samsung X125
review]({filename}pages/samsung-x125-review.md).

Soon, I'll publish at least one more article about this subnotebook:
Installing Arch Linux on the Samsung X125. And maybe another article
about how to get the "F4" recovery functionality working again after
you've accidentally overwritten the MBR (why
yes of course I broke it by installing GRUB on
the MBR).
