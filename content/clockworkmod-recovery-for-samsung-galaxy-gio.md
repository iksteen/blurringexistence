I just released the first version of my ClockworkMod Recovery port for
the Samsung Galaxy Gio GT-S5660 on [Particle
Android](http://particle.blurringexistence.net/samsung-gt-s5660/clockworkmod-recovery "Particle Android").

Porting it was fairly trivial thanks to Samsung releasing the source
code for the Linux kernel used on the device and the Galaxy Ace
cyanogenmod device profile by
[ilarrain](http://github.com/ilarrain "ilarrain").

I’ll document the kernel changes I’ve made soonish.
