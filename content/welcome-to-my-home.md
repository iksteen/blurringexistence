It's been a while since I've had a blog, sometimes I miss it so I
started a new one. I don't know how regularly or about what I'll be
posting here, just prepare to be amazingly underwhelmed! I expect
entries to be in English or Dutch depending on my mood and target
audience.

Oh yeah, and I need a better theme! Suggestions are welcome, I'm using
the Serendipity weblog engine.
