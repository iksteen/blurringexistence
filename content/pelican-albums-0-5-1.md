I've released version 0.5.1 of pelican-albums (my image album and thumbnail plugin for pelican). The most significant
change (apart from some documentation improvements) is that it now automatically excludes documents inside the album
path from becoming articles or pages.

Get it now:

- `pip install -U pelican-albums`
- [pelican-albums 0.5.1 on pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pelican-albums/0.5.1)
- [pelican-albums 0.5.1 on GitHub](https://github.com/iksteen/pelican-albums/releases/tag/v0.5.1)
